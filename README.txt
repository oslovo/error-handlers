handling messages

Using Rapidsms handlers for parsing incoming messages, The DEFAULT APPLICATION responds to messages that no other 
application has handled, normally its the last in INSTALLED_APPS, responding to requests that no other app has responded to,
error-handlers demonstrates how you can use DEFAULT_RESPONSE of the DEFAULT APPLICATION to serve customised messages to a user.
